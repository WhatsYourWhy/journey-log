# This was a simple AI Prompt creation using LLM. Very Basic and simple to do list.

# If you would like to experiment with single prompt upgrades. This may show the evolution of LLM capabilities as a historical coding assistant. 

This repository captures the evolution from an early LLM-generated prototype to the current workflow powered by OpenAI Codex. It shows how iterative prompts and code refinement can steadily improve a simple idea.

# The Journey Log

A simple and stylish to-do list application with a touch of wisdom and customizable themes.

## Overview

The Journey Log is a web-based to-do list designed to help you track your tasks as "steps" in your personal journey. It allows you to:

* **Add new steps:** Easily input and add tasks to your log.
* **View your journey:** See a clear list of your current steps.
* **Mark steps as complete:** Check off completed tasks, which will be visually marked with a strikethrough and optionally reveal an insightful quote.
* **Delete steps:** Remove tasks from your log.
* **Clear completed steps:** Quickly remove all finished tasks to keep your log tidy.
* **Customize the look:** Choose from different visual themes to personalize your Journey Log.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** Provides the structural foundation of the application.
* **CSS:** Handles the styling and visual presentation, including different themes.
* **JavaScript:** Implements the interactive functionality, data management (using local storage), and theme switching.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Start adding your journey steps in the input field and click "Add Step" or press Enter.
4. Check the checkbox next to a task to mark it as complete and potentially see a piece of wisdom.
5. Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it.
6. Use the "Clear Completed Steps" button to remove all finished tasks.
7. Select a theme from the "Choose a theme" dropdown to change the appearance of the application. Your theme preference will be saved.

# The Journey Log

A simple and stylish to-do list application with a touch of wisdom and customizable themes.

* **Mark steps as complete:** Check off completed tasks, which will be visually marked with a strikethrough and optionally reveal an insightful quote.
* **Delete steps:** Remove tasks from your log.
* **Clear completed steps:** Quickly remove all finished tasks to keep your log tidy.
* **Customize the look:** Choose from different visual themes to personalize your Journey Log.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** Provides the structural foundation of the application.
* **CSS:** Handles the styling and visual presentation, including different themes.
* **JavaScript:** Implements the interactive functionality, data management (using local storage), and theme switching.
